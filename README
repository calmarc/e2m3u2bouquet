quick hack (line 367...) .. to generate 1:1 picon's identical to the sender name - when
generating picons (i.e. -P) (instead of lowercase etc)

Since VTI can't handle lowercase ones, it seems.

so.. ssh into box
cd /etc/enigma2/e2m3u2bouquet
rm e2m3u2bouquet.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calmarc/e2m3u2bouquet/master/e2m3u2bouquet.py
chmod a+x e2m3u2bouquet.py
# either put in config: <picons>1</picons>
# or issue with -P switch
./e2m3u2bouquet.py

And it should generate picons with just the name as the senders - and therefore works also on VTI.
